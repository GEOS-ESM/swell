Preparation of the configuration happens in several steps. Note that the configuration determines
templates and construction of the flow.cylc file.

1. The user chooses the suite they wish to run.

2. The code then builds a list of suite questions that do not depend on the model. At around the
   same time the code determines all the tasks within that suite that do not depend on the model
   component. At that point all these questions are asked using the question client.

3. If there is some dependency on model component(s) in the flow.cylc then the code will ask the
