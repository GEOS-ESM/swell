# Creating an experiment using Swell

Once you have installed `swell` and configured `cylc` you should be able to create and run an experiment.

In order to run an experiment you need a configuration file with all the experiment parameters. This can be generated by running `swell_prepare_experiment_config`. Two modes are available for generating configuration, using the prescribed defaults or using an interface that guides you through dynamically changing questions. The latter is still being worked on and is not fully supported yet. To generate the default configuration file issue:

```
swell_prepare_experiment_config defaults
```

This will create an `experiment.yaml` file and show the path where the file is created.

The next step is to create the actual experiment. This is done with:

```
swell_create_experiment path/to/experiment.yaml
```

Alternatively you can combine the above two steps with:

```
swell_create_experiment defaults
```
